## My last review ##

- The instructions do not mention creating a _history.md_ file. Only mentions readme files and one _history.txt_ file.
- I created a file _history.md_ and outlined every command from the instructions on Git Basic Exercises.
- Lastly, if not done properly, please instruct me with the exact instruction.
